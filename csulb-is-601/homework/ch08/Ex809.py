"In the law firm Tybo and Associates, there are six partners. 
Listed is the number of cases each partner actually tried in 
court last month.

Partner    Number of Cases
Ruud        3
Wu          6
Sass        3
Flores      3
Wilhelms    0
Schueller   1

a. How many different samples of size 3 are possible?
b. List all possible samples of size 3, and compute the mean number of cases in each sample.
c. Compare the mean of the distribution of sample means to the population mean.
d. On a chart similar to Chart 8â€“2, compare the dispersion in the population with that of the sample means."
