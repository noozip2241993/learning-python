'''
Nikeâ€™s annual report says that the average American buys 6.5 pairs of sports shoes per year. 
Suppose a sample of 81 customers is surveyed and the population standard deviation of sports 
shoes purchased per year is 2.1.

a. What is the standard error of the mean in this experiment?
b. What is the probability that the sample mean is between six and seven pairs of sports shoes?
c. What is the probability that the difference between the sample mean and the population mean is less than 0.25 pair?
d. What is the likelihood the sample mean is greater than seven pairs?
