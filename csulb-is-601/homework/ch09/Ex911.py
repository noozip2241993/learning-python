'''
The owner of Brittenâ€™s Egg Farm wants to estimate the mean number of eggs produced 
per chicken. A sample of 20 chickens shows they produced an average of 20 eggs per 
month with a standard deviation of 2 eggs per month.

a. What is the value of the population mean? What is the best estimate of this value?
b. Explain why we need to use the t-distribution. What assumption do you need to make?
c. For a 95% confidence interval, what is the value of t?
d. What is the margin of error?
e. Develop the 95% confidence interval for the population mean.
f. Would it be reasonable to conclude that the population mean is 21 eggs? What about 25 eggs?
