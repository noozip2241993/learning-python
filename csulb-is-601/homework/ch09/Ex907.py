"Bob Nale is the owner of Naleâ€™s Quick Fill. Bob would like 
to estimate the mean number of gallons of gasoline sold to 
his customers. Assume the number of gallons sold follows the 
normal distribution with a population standard deviation of 
2.30 gallons. From his records, he selects a random sample 
of 60 sales and finds the mean number of gallons sold is 8.60.

a. What is the point estimate of the population mean?
b. Develop a 99% confidence interval for the population mean.
c. Interpret the meaning of part (b).
