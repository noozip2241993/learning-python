'''(Modified average Function) The average function we defined in Section 4.11
can receive any number of arguments. If you call it with no arguments, however, the function causes a ZeroDivisionError. Reimplement average to receive one required argument and the arbitrary argument list argument *args, and update its calculation
accordingly. Test your function. The function will always require at least one argument,
so youâ€™ll no longer be able to get a ZeroDivisionError. When you call average with no
arguments, Python should issue a TypeError indicating "average() missing 1 required
positional argument."'''

#Throws DivideByZero exception
#def average(*args):
#    return sum(args) / len(args)
#average()


def average(arg1, *args):
    total = arg1 + sum(args)
    count = 1 + len(args)
    return  total / count
print(average(1))
