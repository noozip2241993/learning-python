''' Simple exception handling
Place in a try suite a significant logical section of a program in which several statements
can raise exceptions, rather than wrapping a separate try statement around every state-
ment that raises an exception. However, for proper exception-handling granularity, each
try statement should enclose a section of code small enough that, when an exception
occurs, the specific context is known and the except handlers can process the exception
properly. If many statements in a try suite raise the same exception types, multiple try
statements may be required to determine each exceptionâ€™s context.
