'''
Create a function that randomly generates and returns a tuple of 
two positive one-digit integers. Then prompt the user for the 
multiplication of the two numbers. For example, if the generated 
number is 3 and 7, the prompt message is 

How much is 3 times 7? 

Then compare the user answer with the correct result. If the answer 
is correct, display a message “done”. Otherwise, if the user input 
20, prompt:

“3 times 7 is not 20, please try again: “

Keep asking the user input until it type the correct answer.
