'''
A prime number is a number that is only evenly divisble by itself and 1.
For example, the number 5 is prime because it can only be evenlly divided by 1
and 5. The number 6, however, is not prime because it can be divided evenly
by 2 and 3.

Write a Boolean function named is_prime which takes an integer as an argument
and returns true if the argument is a prime number, or false otherwise. 

Then write a program that generates six random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) 
and print out the result like the following (each run will have six different 
random numbers):

The random number 87 is a not a prime number.
The random number 23 is a prime number.
The random number 34 is a not a prime number.
The random number 96 is a not prime number.
The random number 6 is a not a prime number.
The random number 11 is a prime number.
