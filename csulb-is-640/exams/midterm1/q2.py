'''
Please write a program that use nested loop to draw the following pattern. 

-	You must use nested loop to draw the pattern 
-	Define and use the ROWS = 30 constant to draw the pattern for 30 rows.
-	Each row has a row number that has a width of 4 and is right aligned. 
-	There a space after the row number, followed by the first # char.
-	From the 2nd row, each row has one more space between the two # chars. 2nd row has one space char, 3rd row has two space chars, and so on and so forth. The 30th row has 29 space chars.
